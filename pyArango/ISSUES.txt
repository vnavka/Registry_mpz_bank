* Graph definitions are not loaded from the db but only defined in the code.
=> a graph that has been created outside of pyArango won't load

* Using the from collection import * with import pyArango.connection as PAC
causes the metaclass for collections to load twice, and classes might not 
be referenced by the metaclass. the import as should be avoided
